## ðŸ”ŠðŸ”Š Important Announcement: Project Rewrite

Hello Everyone,

I hope this message finds you well. We wanted to take a moment to share some exciting news about the future of our project. Kicks Citi is getting a rewrite!

### Why the Change?

Kicks Citi being my first react native project, had alot of problems. I've decided to embark on a significant overhaul of this project. This decision stems from my commitment to providing a more robust, maintainable, and scalable application that can better meet the evolving needs of our users.

### Background:

This project was initially my first venture into React Native development. As I've gained experience and insights, I've recognized opportunities for improvement. To ensure I deliver the best possible app, I've made the decision to start afresh and apply the lessons learned through out my years to building a worthy project.

### What's Changing?

#### Code Changes:

- **Transition to TypeScript (TS):** We're migrating from JavaScript (JS) to TypeScript (TS) for a more efficient and safer development experience.
- **Backend Migration:** Transitioning from Firebase to AWS for improved scalability, performance, and flexibility in managing our backend infrastructure.
- **Email Marketing Integration:** Implementing email marketing to keep you informed about exciting updates, promotions, and relevant content.
- **Push Notifications:** Enhancing user engagement with the introduction of push notifications, ensuring you stay connected with the latest app activities.

#### App Changes:

- **Design Overhaul:** We are refreshing the app's design to provide a more modern, intuitive, and visually appealing experience.
- **User-to-User Marketplace:** Introducing a new feature that allows users to post shoes for sale on our platform, fostering a dynamic marketplace within the app.
- **Pay on Delivery:** A new payment option has been added, allowing users to pay for their purchases upon delivery.
- **Affiliate Program:** Users can now leverage affiliate links for all products, giving them an opportunity to earn money through the platform.
- **Revamped Sign-Up Flow:** The sign-up process is being redesigned for a smoother and more user-friendly onboarding experience.

and many more...
